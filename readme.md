ElasticAggregator
=================

An utility PHP wrapper for [elasticsearch-php](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-php), for an easier usage of [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elasticsearch)'s [Aggregation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html) framework. Its DSL is fairly straight-forward, but nested arrays are tedious and error-prone to be manually constructed. Also resulting responses have a quite verbose structure which is not typically necessary.


Features and goals
--------
 - Simple aggregation query construction ([AggregationQuery.php](https://github.com/NikoNyrh/ElasticAggregator/blob/master/src/NikoNyrh/ElasticAggregator/AggregationQuery.php))
 - Simple aggregation result parsing and "condensing" ((AggregationResponse.php)[https://github.com/NikoNyrh/ElasticAggregator/blob/master/src/NikoNyrh/ElasticAggregator/AggregationResponse.php])
 - Clean, minimalistic interfaces (combined at (Aggregator.php)[https://github.com/NikoNyrh/ElasticAggregator/blob/master/src/NikoNyrh/ElasticAggregator/Aggregator.php])
 - Well tested codebase
 - Configurable and customizable for differend needs


TODO
--------
 - Decide a better naming convention of public functions (to reflect better the underlying bucketing and metric aggregations), **this will break code compatibility with this initial version**
 - Support for more than one aggregation at any query level (currenly all bucketing aggregations are nested within the previous aggregation)
 - Improve the overall the flexibility of the library, now this only works on trivial use cases
 - Write tests for all existing aggregation queries
 - Use 4 spaces instead of tabs? That PSR-2 stuff... :(
 - Start using this in my own procjets instead of its earlier un-tested version
 - Confirm that including this project via Composer works as intended
 - Is it good idea to configure index name at Aggregator constructor but configure object's type in exec() method?
 - Actual documentation on how stuff works, especially if the codebase grows significantly bigger


Example usage
--------
```php
// Create the standard ElasticSearch client object
$client = new \Elasticsearch\Client(array(
    'hosts' => 'localhost:9200',
));

// Create the aggregator, configure the index name
$aggregator = new \NikoNyrh\ElasticAggregator\Aggregator(
    $client,
    array('index' => 'index_name')
);

// For each "user" get stats on post_length field
$result = $aggregator
    ->aggregate('terms', 'user')
    ->stats('post_length')
    ->exec('type_name');

echo json_encode($result, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
```

Result:
```json
{
    "User 4": {
        "post_length": {
            "count": 25,
            "min": 34,
            "max": 193,
            "avg": 109.44,
            "sum": 2736
        }
    },
    "User 2": {
        "post_length": {
            "count": 22,
            "min": 31,
            "max": 199,
            "avg": 121.5,
            "sum": 2673
        }
    }
}
```

The corresponding raw query and response of this simple aggregation look like this:
```json
{
    "index": "index_name",
    "type": "type_name",
    "body": {
        "size": 0,
        "aggs": {
            "user_agg": {
                "terms": {
                    "field": "user"
                },
                "aggs": {
                    "post_length_stats": {
                        "stats": {
                            "field": "post_length"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
and
```json
{
    "took": 1,
    "timed_out": false,
    "_shards": {
        "total": 1,
        "successful": 1,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "hits": {
        "total": 100,
        "max_score": 0,
        "hits": []
    },
    "aggregations": {
        "user_agg": {
            "buckets": [
                {
                    "key": "User 4",
                    "doc_count": 25,
                    "post_length_stats": {
                        "count": 25,
                        "min": 34,
                        "max": 193,
                        "avg": 109.44,
                        "sum": 2736
                    }
                },
                {
                    "key": "User 2",
                    "doc_count": 22,
                    "post_length_stats": {
                        "count": 22,
                        "min": 31,
                        "max": 199,
                        "avg": 121.5,
                        "sum": 2673
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

I guess you see my point on why this is usually overly verbose.
